**What do programmers and software engineers do once they are more than 50 years old?**
	The ones I know keep working as software developers.I don’t know where the idea comes from that software developers retire early. They basically don’t compared to many/most professions.Software developers rarely make the kind of money to retire early (like bankers might). Software development isn’t a physically demanding job like a police officer, or **tradesman（临售商）**, or maybe a nurse, so we don’t have to retire for that reason.

​	It’s really a fiction that software developers don’t work past 50, and I’ve no idea where it comes from.

​	I think the question is rooted in the assumption of **ageism（年龄偏见主义）** where “old” (50+) software engineers aren’t able to work because they aren’t able to **keep up with the times** and all these new grads can code circles around them.


​	And where does the idea that this is the only profession you get worse at the more experience you have? Nobody thinks “That lawyer is 51, he’s well past it!”.

**Why, when parents argue in front of a young child, does the child seem to favor（喜欢偏向） the aggressor（侵略者，攻击者）? I have seen this happen so many times where the child gravitates（吸引） toward the one doing all the yelling and screaming and can't fathom why.**

1964 I'm 8, my brothers are 6 and 10. After some hours of the the usual screaming and abuse, he comes and gets us all out of bed, lines us up on the couch, and says, “Who do you love best, your mother or me?” I can still see my mother **hovering（hover徘徊）** in the background.One by one, we betray her, telling him we love him best. And the lie worked. It got us back to the relative safety of our beds.We “sided" with him because we were terrified of him.

​	So lately, my 13-year-old son had been **acting a little... entitled（自命不凡）**. Acting like he's too good to shop at Wal-Mart or making **snarky（尖刻的）** comments about kids at school who shop at the goodwill and quite a few other things. I don't tolerate that. Today, he took his own 20.00 to the goodwill to buy clothes to wear the entire week to school. Whatever he found is what he would have to wear. He isn't happy and shed a few tears, but I firmly believe in 15 years, he will look back and laugh at the day his Mom made him shop at goodwill. I want to teach my kids that **money isn't everything,** and if you have to degrade other people because of where they shop, you too will shop there. Side note, I love the goodwill!!
