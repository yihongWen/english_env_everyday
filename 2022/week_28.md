**OUTPUT HARDWARE**

​	Output hardware consists of external devices that transfer information from the computer’s CPU to the computer user. A video display, or screen, converts information generated by the computer into visual information. Displays commonly take one of two forms: a video screen with a **cathode ray tube(阴极射线管)** (CRT) or a video screen with a liquid crystal display (LCD). A CRT-based screen, or monitor, looks similar to a television set. Information from the CPU is displayed using a beam of electrons that scans a phosphorescent surface that emits light and creates images. An LCD-based screen displays visual information on a flatter and smaller screen than a CRT-based video monitor. LCDs are frequently used in laptop computers. 

​	Printers take text and image from a computer and print them on paper. Dot-matrix printers use tiny wires to impact upon an inked ribbon to form characters. Laser printers employ beams of light to draw images on a drum that then **picks up（捡起、吸收）** **fine black particles（黑色细小颗粒）** called **toner（粉末）**. The toner is **fused（融合）** to a page to produce an image. **Inkjet（喷墨）** printers fire **droplets（小滴）** of ink onto a page to form characters and pictures. 



**STORAGE HARDWARE** 

​	Storage hardware provides permanent storage of information and programs for **retrieval（找回）** by the computer. The two main types of storage devices are disk drives and memory. There are several types of disk drives: hard, floppy, magneto-optical, and compact. Hard disk drives store information in magnetic particles embedded in a disk. Usually a permanent part of the computer, hard disk drives can store large amounts of information and retrieve that information very quickly. Floppy disk drives also store information in magnetic particles embedded in removable disks that may be floppy or rigid. Floppy disks store less information than a hard disk drive and retrieve the information at a much slower rate. Magneto-optical disc drives store information on removable discs that are sensitive to both laser light and magnetic fields. They can typically store as much information as hard disks but have slightly slower retrieval speeds. Compact disc drives (CD-ROM) store information on pits burned into the surface of a disc of reflective material.  The information stored on CD-ROMs cannot be erased or overwritten with new information. They can store about as much information as a hard drive but have a slower rate of information retrieval. 

​	Memory refers to the computer chips that store information for quick retrieval by the CPU. Random access memory (RAM) is used to store the information and instructions that operate the computer’s programs. Typically, programs are transferred from storage on a disk drive to RAM. RAM is also known as volatile memory because the information within the computer chips is lost when power to the computer is turned off. Read-only memory (ROM) contains critical information and software that must be permanently available for computer operation, such as the operating system that directs the computer’s actions from start up to shut down. ROM is called nonvolatile memory because the memory chips do not lose their information when power to the computer is turned off. 

​	Some devices serve more than one purpose. For example, floppy disks may also be used as input devices if they contain information to be used and processed by the computer user. In addition, they can be used as output devices if the user wants to store the results of computations on them. 



**HARDWARE CONNECTIONS**

​	To function, hardware requires physical connections that allow components to communicate and interact. A bus provides a common interconnected system composed of a group of wires or circuitry that **coordinates（坐标、协调）** and moves information between the internal parts of a computer. A computer bus consists of two channels: one that the CPU uses to locate data, called the address bus, and another to send the data to that address, called the data bus. A bus is characterized by two features: how much information it can manipulate at one time, called the bus width, and how quickly it can transfer these data. 

​	A serial connection is a wire or set of wires used to transfer information from the CPU to an external device such as a mouse, keyboard, modem, scanner, and some types of printers. This type of connection transfers only one piece of data at a time, and is therefore slow. The advantage to using a serial connection is that it provides effective connections over long distances. 

​	A parallel connection uses multiple sets of wires to transfer blocks of information simultaneously. Most scanners and printers use this type of connection. A parallel connection is much faster than a serial connection, but it is limited to distances of less than 3 m (10 ft) between the CPU and the external device.
