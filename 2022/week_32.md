**Geographic Information System** 

​	What Is a GIS? A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer-based tool for mapping and analyzing things that exist and events that happen on earth. GIS technology integrates common database operations such as query and statistical analysis with the unique visualization and geographic analysis benefits offered by maps. These abilities distinguish a GIS from other information systems and make it valuable to a wide range of public and private enterprises for explaining events, predicting outcomes, and planning strategies. 

​	Mapmaking and geographic analysis are not new, but a GIS performs these tasks better and faster than do the old manual methods. And, before GIS technology, only a few people had the skills necessary to use geographic information to help with decision making and problem solving. Today, GIS is a multibillion-dollar industry employing hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. GIS is taught in schools, colleges, and universities throughout the world. Professionals in every field are increasingly aware of the advantages of thinking and working geographically. 



**What Are the Components of a GIS?** 

​	A working GIS integrates five key components: hardware, software, data, people, and methods. 

**Hardware** 

​	Hardware is the computer on which a GIS operates. Today, GIS software runs on a wide range of hardware types, from centralized computer servers to desktop computers used in **stand-alone（独立的）** or networked configurations.

**Software**

​	GIS software provides the functions and tools needed to store, analyze, and display geographic information. Key software components are:

- Tools for the input and manipulation of geographic information
- A database management system (DBMS) 
- Tools that support geographic query, analysis, and visualization
- A graphical user interface (GUI) for easy access to tools 

**Data** 

​	Possibly the most important component of a GIS is the data. Geographic data and related **tabular（表格）** data can be collected in-house or purchased from a commercial data provider. A GIS will integrate spatial data with other data resources and can even use a DBMS, used by most organizations to organize and maintain their data, to manage spatial data.

**People** 

​	GIS technology is of limited value without the people who manage the system and develop plans for applying it to real-world problems. GIS users range from technical specialists who design and maintain the system to those who use it to help them perform their everyday work.

**Methods** 

​	A successful GIS operates according to a well-designed plan and business rules, which are the models and operating practices unique to each organization. 



**How Does a GIS Work?** 

​	A GIS stores information about the world as a collection of thematic layers that can be linked together by geography. This simple but extremely powerful and **versatile（通用） concept** has proven **invaluable（无价的）** for solving many real-world problems from tracking delivery vehicles, to recording details of planning applications, to modeling global atmospheric circulation.

**Geographic References** 

​	Geographic information contains either an explicit geographic reference, such as a **latitude（纬度）** and **longitude（经度）** or national **grid（网格）** coordinate, or an implicit reference such as an address, postal code, or road name. An automated process called geocoding is used to create explicit geographic references (multiple locations) from implicit references (descriptions such as addresses). These geographic references allow you to locate features and events on the earth’s surface for analysis.

**Vector and Raster（光栅） Models** 

Geographic information systems work with two fundamentally different types of geographic models—the “vector” model and the “raster” model. In the vector model, information about points, lines, and **polygons（多边形）** is encoded and stored as a collection of x,y coordinates. The location of a point feature, such as a bore hole, can be described by a single x,y coordinate. Linear features, such as roads and rivers, can be stored as a collection of point coordinates. Polygonal features, such as sales **territories（领土）** and river **catchments（流域）**, can be stored as a closed loop of coordinates. The vector model is extremely useful for describing **discrete（离散）** features, but less useful for describing continuously varying features such as soil type. The raster model has evolved to model such continuous features. A raster image comprises a collection of grid cells rather like a scanned map or picture. Both the vector and raster models for storing geographic data have unique advantages and disadvantages. Modern GISs are able to handle both models.

 

**What Can a GIS Do for You?** 

**Performing Geographic Queries and Analysis** 

​	The ability of GISs to search databases and perform geographic queries has saved many companies literally millions of dollars. GISs have helped reduce costs by:

- **Streamlining(精简)** customer service 
- Reducing land acquisition costs through better analysis
- Reducing fleet maintenance costs through better **logistics（后勤、物流）**
- Analyzing data quickly 

​	An example of the last point is: a **realtor（房地产经纪人）** could use a GIS to find all houses within a certain area that have tiled roofs and five bedrooms, and then list their characteristics. The query could be further **refined（精炼）** by adding **criteria（标准、条件）**—the house must cost less than $100 per square foot. You could also list houses within a certain distance of a school. 

**Improving Organizational Integration** 

​	Many organizations that have implemented a GIS have found that one of its main benefits is improved management of their own organization and resources. Because GISs have the ability to link data sets together by geography, they facilitate **interdepartmental（不同学科之间）** information sharing and communication. By creating a shared database, one department can benefit from the work of another—data can be collected once and used many times. 

**Making Better Decisions** 

​	The old **adage（谚语）** “**better information leads to better decisions**” is as true for a GIS as it is for other information systems. A GIS, however, is not an automated decision making system but a tool to query, analyze, and map data in support of the decision making process. GIS technology has been used to assist in tasks such as presenting information at planning inquiries, helping resolve territorial **disputes（争端）**, and siting **pylons（塔架）** in such a way as to minimize visual **intrusion（侵入）**. A GIS can be used to help reach a decision about the location of a new housing development that has minimal environmental impact, is located in a low-risk area, and is close to a population center. The information can be presented **succinctly（简洁）** and clearly in the form of a map and accompanying report, allowing decision makers to focus on the real issues rather than try to understand the data. Because GIS products can be produced quickly, multiple scenarios can be evaluated efficiently and effectively. 

**Making Maps** 

​	Maps have a special place in GIS (see Figure 12B-1). The process of making maps with GIS is much more flexible than are traditional manual or automated cartography approaches. It begins with database creation. Existing paper maps can be digitized and computer-**compatible（兼容）** information can be translated into the GIS. The GIS-based **cartographic（制图的）** database can be both continuous and scale free. Map products can then be created centered on any location, at any scale, and showing selected information symbolized effectively to highlight specific characteristics. The characteristics of **atlases（地图册）** and map series can be encoded in computer programs and compared with the database at final production time. Digital products for use in other GISs can also be derived by simply copying data from the database. In a large organization, **topographic（地质的）** databases can be used as reference frameworks by other departments. 



**Summary** 

​	In today’s global community, the more information you have at your fingertips, the easier it is to make an informed decision. In today’s high-tech world, information comes in many different ways, from company reports and statistics from down the hall to digital photos and multimedia from across the world. Information can be overwhelming and the need for timely decisions calls not only for innovative ways to access accurate, up-to-the-minute information, but also tools to help present the information in useful ways. A geographic information system or GIS allows you to bring all types of data together based on the geographic and locational component of the data. But unlike a static paper map, GIS can display many layers of information that is useful to you. GIS will give you the power to create maps, integrate information, visualize scenarios, solve complicated problems, present powerful ideas, and develop effective solutions like never before. Relationships between the data will become more apparent and your data will become more valuable. GIS is a tool used by individuals, schools, governments, and businesses seeking innovative ways to solve their problems.

**Agent Technology**

**Introduction What is an agent?** 

​	In essence, an agent is a software system which can act on behalf of a human or another system. Agent is a convenient **metaphor（比喻）** for describing software systems which we would all like to have—the “intelligent software servant” that is easy to instruct. In research, a more **rigorous（严密的）** definition which is often used is: an agent is a software system, situated in some environment, which is capable of behaviour that is proactive, autonomous, communicative, persistent, and timely. Some agents might have additional attributes such as **mobility（活动性）**, **benevolence（慈善）**, and learning ability. Stronger notions of agency employ concepts such as knowledge, belief, goals and intentions, and provide a logic for **reasoning（推理）** with these concepts. These properties are useful and reflect human intelligence but they are hard to fully realize in a software system. Not all agents have (or need) all these properties, and some agents have these properties in varying degrees. We rely on **intuition（直觉）** to perceive and judge the degree of these properties in a software system, since the properties are generally difficult to quantify or measure. Nevertheless, numerous theories for understanding and modelling properties of agent systems and tools for building agents are being developed in over fifty research laboratories world-wide. The Agent Society (www.agent.org) and AgentLink (www.agentlink.org) are two international organizations formed for the purposes of coordinating agent research and development. Agent research crosses **disciplines（科学、训练）** and has been influenced by areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed computing, software engineering, sociology, economics, object-oriented systems, artificial life, and game theory. In fact, a strength of agent technology is that it combines such areas to build systems more sophisticated than that possible using one technology alone. This strength and the appeal of the agent abstraction accounts in part for the diversity of software solutions possible with the concept of agents. 

**Applications** 

​	We look at a sampling of agent application areas.

**The Internet and the World Wide Web** 

​	The Web provides an **impetus（动力）** for agent research. Information agents naturally fit the role of software assistants which help people find, reason with, synthesize, and manage desired knowledge from the gargantuan Web. While Web documents have some structure, much of the information is still in free text, **hindering（阻碍）** full understanding of text by agents. However, useful agents for gathering, filtering, sharing, and monitoring Web resources and guiding Web surfers have been built using limited natural language processing and complex keyword-based text searching. Such agent products have been deployed and are being marketed. 

​	XML , which generalizes HTML to admit domain-specific tags, provides a standard way of imposing more structure on information. However, the use of XML is still limited compared to HTML. 

​	Email filtering and responding is another application where agents prioritize, delete, forward or archive messages for users. Useful tools have been built and marketed without full natural language understanding.

**Electronic Commerce** 

​	Electronic commerce is an area of growing importance **spurred（鞭策）** by the popularity of the Internet and the Web. While the Web enables a company to be online twenty-four hours a day and be **contactable（可接触的）** by the masses, it also provides an electronic storefront with which agents can interact. Intensive agent research is **underway（在进行中）** to automate product advertising and **brokering（代理）**, merchant brokering, negotiation, purchase and delivery, and customer services. Full and effective automation of electronic commerce is **nontrivial（重要的）** and requires not only technological designs but also standards for **unambiguously（不含糊的）** defining commerce-related information such as goods and services, customer and business profiles, and electronic forms.

**Manufacturing**

​	Manufacturing control and factory automation is an area of active research. Agent systems are being developed for designing products, controlling manufacturing robots, and managing factory production processes. 

**And More…** 

​	Other areas of agent research and development include business process management (agent-based systems for streamlining business processes have been developed), telecommunications (e.g. automating network management and efficient service provisioning), medical informatics (e.g. automating decision making in patient monitoring and multi-agent based distributed health care system), entertainment, air traffic control, pilot training, and distributed data mining.



**Mobile Computing—Software and Hardware** 

​	The increasingly distributed and mobile workforce and enterprise is **fueling（给...提供燃料）** research into mobile agent systems. The **attraction（吸引力）** is the ability to send agents to remote hosts, disconnect from these hosts, and reconnect to retrieve answers. For agents to roam the Internet, the capability of “write once, run anywhere” is **imperative（极其重要的）**. Sun’s Java language which has captured the world’s attention via Web applets has provision for platform independent execution, and so, has been used for more than a dozen mobile agent toolkits. With Java being introduced in “soft” embedded devices such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants and **handheld（手持）** terminals, agents might (if need to) roam mobile environments. However, mobile agent research has so far largely been confined toresearch proposals and prototypes. There is hardly any commercial **off-the-shelf（现成的）** mobile agent-based application. Further research in building **robust（强壮的）** mobile agent applications is still required. Issues such as security and robustness are being **tackled（处理）**—mobile agents might become **commonplace（平凡的）** in the next decade. 



**Standardization** 

​	For agents to cooperate, flexible and standard means of agent communication is required. Development and standardization of agent communication languages is being carried out. FIPA1 (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) (www.fipa.org), a standards organization in the agent area, has more than forty participants including British Telecom2 , Hitachi3 , NEC, Siemens4 , IBM, and Sun Microsystems. FIPA aims to make available specifications that facilitate inter-operability between agent systems. Specifications for agent management (e.g. directory services, and life cycle) and agent communication have been proposed. The Object Management Group® (OMGTM) (www.omg.org) is also working on standards to allow mobile agent systems to inter-operate. 

**Conclusion**

​	 Agent technology is a thriving area of research, and it is also an emerging industry. As toolkits and methodologies for developing agent systems emerge, applications where agents will be a key abstraction will increase.

**Electronic Commerce** 

**DEFINITION** 

​	Electronic commerce may be defined as the entire set of processes that support commercial activities on a network and involve information analysis. These activities **spawn(大量生产)** product information and display events, services, providers, consumers, advertisers, support for transactions, brokering systems for a variety of services and actions (e.g., finding certain products, finding cheaply priced products, etc.), security of transactions, user authentication, etc. It involves “the enablement of a business vision supported by advanced information technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness within the trading process”. Although the term itself has gained attention only in recent years, electronic commerce has been around in various forms for over 20 years. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and **Electronic Funds Transfer（电子资金传送）** (EFT2 ) technologies were first introduced in the late 1970s. The growth and acceptance of credit cards, **Automated Teller（出纳） Machines（自动取款机）** , and telephone banking in the 1980s are also forms of EC . While many of these electronic trading technologies have had radical effects within their own markets and created their fair share of publicity, none have attracted the level of **hype（炒作）** or have been **hailed（赞扬、欢呼）** as **purveyors** of economic transformation to the extent that electronic commerce has in recent years. 



**REQUIREMENTS AND SERVICES** 

​	In order to effectively use electronic commerce, users of such systems require various types of **wide-ranging（广泛）** functionalities that include the ability to search for and access relevant information efficiently, make monetary transactions for purchasing and selling products and services, and secure business transactions against intentional and unintentional **corruption（腐败、损害）** and theft of data. 

**Acquiring and Storing Information**

​	To build a global electronic marketplace, first we need to deal with the problem of digitizing currently available information such as catalogs, books, films, maps, and audio at a variety of quality levels. Data may also already exist in digital form but in a **legacy（遗产、遗留）** format that must be transformed to be useful. In addition to the technical aspect of this problem, there is also the economic aspect—the costs of digitizing or converting the information. Second, as new information is made available by information providers (individuals, small businesses, large corporations) we need to have mechanisms to capture and store this information. An EC storage system must be capable of storing a large amount of data in a variety of formats and must provide efficient and effective access to this data. 

**Search and Discovery Services** 

​	Online information search capabilities are important to provide users access to important data such as information about products, services, customers, suppliers, and government agencies. Information search and discovery services include electronic catalogs (e-catalogs) and directories, information filters, search engines, and software agents. Electronic catalogs organize information based on content and allow users to browse through and select the relevant documents. Such methods, while simple to implement, assume certain organization schemes that may not match the requirement of every user. Furthermore, for systems that require frequent updates, such methods may not be efficient because of the frequency of reorganization required. Information filters are available for users to retrieve the relevant documents to their queries. These filters could be located at the workstation of the end users or at remote sites. Retrieving information from remote sites increases network traffic, and hence it is more efficient to gather metadata rather than to download the data itself. Multimedia information poses additional problems in determining information content and hence in filtering such data. 

​	Software agents such as robots, wanderers, and spiders can traverse and locate relevant information. Such programs are based on limited-depth, depth-first algorithms that traverse using hypertext links through HTML documents in the Web in order to locate and retrieve relevant documents. Several open issues persist with the existing discovery and search services. These include the ability to handle new types of data such as multimedia data including video, sound, and 3D images; developing more efficient content-based indexing methods; and using parallel processing to conduct multiple searches through the document space. 

**Electronic Payments** 

​	EC systems require methods to pay for the delivery of data, products, and services. Electronic payments include digital currencies (smart cards and electronic money), credit card payments, and electronic checks. Smart cards have been developed and are in use for various types of business services—to provide access to financial accounts, to maintain purchase records, and to store personalized information such as shopping **preferences（偏好）** and other data. There are two types of smart cards: relationship-based smart cards that allow financial transactions but require accounting settlements at the end of each billing cycle, and electronic purses and **debit cards（借记卡）** that store sums of money and can be used for a variety of services. After each purchase, the value is **deducted（扣除）** from the electronic purse, and hence no accounting settlement is necessary. 

​	Electronic money (also referred to as digital cash or electronic token) is an electronic payment method that **emulates（仿真）** the real-life exchange of goods and services for their equivalent currencies. Thus, electronic tokens could be stored in users’ computers and transmitted through fixed or intermittent network connections. E-money should be bank-certified for their monetary value in order to avoid the risk of insufficient funds. In addition, these should be exchangeable with other forms of payments (such as paper cash and certified checks), must be **tamper（破坏、篡改）** resistant in order to avoid **fraudulent（欺骗）** payments, and should be accessible from remote locations. As an alternative to storing electronic tokens in the users’ machines, third-party payment services can process payment transactions. Credit card purchases involve the transmission of encrypted data through computer networks. This includes entering credit card information (card number and expiration date) into the system, having it encrypted by the system, and sending the information over the network. The problem with this type of system is their **nonrefutability（不可辩驳）,** which requires the physical presence of the credit card owner for authentication of the signature. Other problems associated with such payment methods are privacy, speed of transactions, and safety. Electronic checks (e-checks) are another mechanism for payments over computer networks. These systems are intended to emulate conventional paper-check processing systems. In this method, a third-party account server acts as a billing service for users. E-checks require digital signatures and authentication services to digitally process information between the payer, payee, and bank. E-checks are suitable for clearing micropayments and are much faster and more efficient than conventional check payment systems. Society has grown accustomed to a wide variety of cost models and financial instruments. EC, however, presents new challenges that are not adequately addressed by these models and instruments. For example, online services presently follow fixed-cost models that are insensitive to changes in data contents and wholesale costs. 

**Security Services** 

​	Systems for electronic commerce have to be secured against a number of threats such as fraudulent activities by internal or external sources, theft of valuable information, and **sabotage（故意毁坏）**. Hence such systems need to be guarded by some specially designed security system to provide security services such as authentication of data and of the entities accessing the system, unauthorized access control, confidentiality, data integrity, and non-**repudiation（否认、拒绝）**. Security systems typically consist of a cryptographic system that performs the encryption of plain text data into **ciphertext（密文）** and decryption of ciphertext back into plain text data. Cryptographic systems can be divided into two categories: a symmetric key cryptosystem where the key information is shared and kept secret between the sender and receiver, and a public key cryptosystem where the sender and the receiver do not share the same key (one can be made public while the other is kept secret). Both symmetric key and public key cryptosystems provide security services such as confidentiality, authentication of data source, and integrity. These are achieved through a variety of techniques, namely, message authentication codes and hash functions in symmetric key cryptosystems and the use of public and private keys in public key cryptosystems. Cryptographic systems of today face various challenges, for example, acceptance of such systems by user groups, distribution and management of keys, and the ease of use of effective encryption and decryption mechanisms. 

**Connectivity** 

​	In an EC environment today, there is a multiplicity of clients. Users may use TV sets, radios, PCs, PDAs1 , laptops, and cellular phones for accessing information. The goal of the National Information Infrastructure (NII 2 ) project is to allow universal access to distributed stores of information (digital libraries) and to provide this access at a reasonable cost to every citizen. Widespread use of EC is predicated on, among others, the universal availability of access for a large number of users. EC systems will have to contend with many different information appliances. In such a heterogeneous world of objects, user interfaces, networks, clients, and servers, the issue of interoperability assumes great importance. 

**Legal and Policy Requirements** 

​	The legal issues involved in electronic commerce relate to the trouble the Internet itself has in dealing with law in **cyberspace（网络空间）**. Legal disputes that have been debated for centuries have begun to surface in cyberspace with renewed **vigor（活力）**. Fundamental civil liberties issues demand new attention in a new environment, and the **ramifications（分支）** of past decisions are not the same in a globally networked environment. While governments and individuals struggle to address freedom of speech, obscenity, and privacy issues on the Internet, the legal issues for electronic commerce are numerous as well. **Intellectual property（知识产权）,** taxation, law enforcement, ubiquitous cryptography, and **contractual（合同）** issues are all unsettled in the growing EC industry. Furthermore, the debate over government involvement in the regulation of electronic business, itself, is still at an immature stage. The issues that require resolution are becoming clear for EC.

The Evolution of e-Business:

​	From the smallest company to the largest enterprise, the Internet has forced **virtually（几乎、事实上、虚拟地）** every business to reconsider the way it operates. In every sector, companies are **scrambling（攀登、争先恐后）** to establish services on the Web. Now a new imperative has emerged: Drive toward a business model that provides **tailored（定做）** services for customers or risk losing business to competitors who will. 

​	The **payoff（回报）** for businesses that make the transition will be huge. At Intel, a new Web e-Business service brought in over $1 billion in orders in its first month. The secure, Web-based product ordering and tracking system has lowered transaction costs and sped delivery for business partners worldwide. Perhaps most important, it delivers customized information to each customer. Intel did more than just bolt a Web front-end onto its existing order-taking systems. Sales, marketing and IT staffs worked together to **craft（工艺、精心制作）** an electronic business solution that automates the order process and strengthens business relationships. It won’t be long before many of your customers will demand this kind of service.

 Take the Stage 

​	For IT professionals, the transition from a traditional **vendor-centric（以供应商为中心）** model to one focused on the customer will prove a crucial test. Companies will **prosper or perish（兴旺、毁灭）** based on their ability to deploy and support customer-oriented e-Business systems that make their business partners more competitive. IT managers will play a driving role in this effort, as business management turns to IT for the tools, knowledge and foresight needed to transform and extend business processes for the Internet Age. As a leader in Internet and business technologies, Intel sees the evolution of e-Business following a four-stage progression. Most important, businesses today face the crucial transition from a vendor-centric model to the emerging customer-centric business model. The table below provides a quick overview of the four stages of e-Business: 

​	How will this transition help your customers? Imagine being able to see an aggregated view of all the partners you do business with, rather than viewing one partner’s Web site at a time. Data will be delivered in binary formats—rather than rigid HTML text—eliminating the need to copy and paste text into systems. Ultimately, customer applications will interact with your business systems. Your customers will receive personalized data, relying on your systems to make them more competitive. The table below shows some key changes that occur in a customer-centric environment: 

​	This customer-centric environment expands the horizons of Web commerce. A customer checking on product deliveries might cull data from your production and **warehousing（仓库）** facilities, your shippers’ tracking systems, and its own receiving department—all using a single interface. What’s more, this information can be delivered in real-time, providing **always-on（不间断）** decision support. 

**The IT Angle**

​	 “Essentially, every business needs to become an information services company,” says Mike Ledford, Chief Technical Officer-Telematics for Ford Motor Company . “You need to do more than just answer the phones, make the sales, and ship the products. You have to give your customers what they want, when they want it, and how they want it—even if that means integrating your processes with other businesses. If you don’t, somebody else will.” To form links with business partners over the Internet, companies may have to **scrap（碎片、报废）** existing business processes and create new ones. It will also require changes to the computing infrastructure. Among the key issues for IT managers to consider:

- Develop robust support systems and in-house technical **acumen（敏锐、聪明）** to meet customer requests for enhanced information delivery.

- Deploy middleware software and servers to support advanced services while maintaining back-end stability.

- **Plan the infrastructure to scale to demand**, particularly as new services emerge and the number of active connections grow.

- Ensure **ample（充足）** performance headroom to allow flexibility and scalability at the client and server. 

​	IT and business management must work together closely to tailor processes and deliver solutions, says Joyce M. Wrenn, Vice President Information Technologies and CIO for Union Pacific Railroad Company. “There are a lot of opportunities out there, but company senior management and IT departments need to start planning now. You can’t deploy advanced e-Business services without **shaking up（摇动、重组）** your business and information infrastructure. It’s hard work, but the payoff will be well worth it.” What Intel Is Doing Intel is working hard to enable this vision of the future, by actively **fostering（养育、培养）** the development of customer-centric solutions. Among the key activities:

- Active engagement with businesses to deploy advanced e-Business systems.

- Investing in technologies that encourage customer-centric solutions.

- Exploring rapid application assembly technologies to enable client-side solutions.

- Enabling high-performance, affordable, standard high volume server building blocks.

- Investing in and optimizing crucial applications and middleware to run on the Intel Architecture. 

​	**These efforts are already starting to bear fruit.（出现成果）** Today, Intel is working with businesses to streamline the delivery of status information. One large company is developing a Stage  delivery solution to manage extremely high server loads produced by customers checking its Web site for status information. The new system automatically sends updates in binary form, controlling the load on the company’s servers while improving customer service. Intel is also helping independent software vendors (ISVs) develop products that deliver customer-centric solutions. For instance, companies are facilitating the integration of packaged, legacy and custom applications into the business process. This technology can help ensure collaboration over the Internet with multiple business partners, including resellers, distributors, manufacturers and customers. 

​	Independent Stage efforts are also underway. Users can already select from Web-based services and products that pull real-time stock quotes and other financial information over the Internet. Software automatically **pours(注入)** the data into **spreadsheets（电子表格）** or other documents. On the customer side of the fence, emerging server and client components allow knowledge workers to build decision-support applications using office productivity tools. Imagine being able to pull product **inventory(轻单)** and order-tracking information off your vendor’s servers from within your spreadsheet. Today, Intel is demonstrating a code generator that produces the necessary scripts, enabling components to be used in a variety of client applications. In between, there is a real need to **uplift（举起）** the computing infrastructure to manage custom data delivery. Middleware servers and applications will provide the glue between back-end systems and custom front-ends. These services will allow **substantial agility（大量的敏捷）** in delivering information while maintaining a stable back-end platform. As customers request additional formats or application support, IT managers can deploy application services to fit their customer’s needs. Middleware on the client will also reduce complexity. 

**Building Foundations**

​	The transition to Stage  is still just emerging, but IT managers need to position their companies now for a customer-centric future. Ultimately, businesses must realize that one global network—the Internet—will connect with and **subsume(包容)** all others. By the same token , the drive to share business processes will **blur（迷糊）** the lines between enterprises. IT managers cannot expect to simply jump to this endpoint, of course. The tools and processes to enable this capability are still being developed. But by carefully formulating e-Business strategies and deploying infrastructures now, IT managers can get started on building capabilities more quickly. New technologies will make it easier for companies to initiate business relationships, while at the same time making relationships more fruitful over the long haul . 



## **08-05:**

**Setting Goals for Your Online Business** 

​	Most businesses realize that they need some kind of Web presence, but they don’t know what that Web presence should be. Other businesses become so **overwhelmed(被压倒)** by the limitless possibilities of being on the Web that they try to do everything they can, or end up doing nothing at all. The only way to successfully create a presence for your business on the Internet is to establish goals for going online, and then tailor your Web site to fit your goals. 

​	Think of establishing goals as creating a business plan for your Web site. **Determine ahead of time（提前决定）** what you want to accomplish by moving your business online. The business plan will save time and money and ensure a more efficient, productive Web site. The Internet is here to stay, so your goals should focus on the long-term benefits of having a Web site rather than the immediate effects. You probably shouldn’t expect to start making money on the Web right away. However, you may get other results from going online that aren’t immediately measurable, such as product promotion or building a new customer base. When creating a business plan, you should know something about the reasons for your business to get on the Web and the types of online businesses. Besides, you should study how similar businesses use the Web. Visiting your competitors’ Web sites and learning what they’re doing online can help you focus your goals. 

**Why take your business online?** 

​	When most people think of opening a Web business, the first thing that springs to mind is selling products or services online. However, online **retail（零售）** is a very small part of what business Web sites are doing. You may not have realized how many other ways a Web site can benefit your business. There are many reasons for your business to get on the Web:

- Sell products and services. If your product or service translates well to online retail, you can create a Web site for taking and processing orders.
- Advertise products and services. Even if you don’t use your Web site to sell goods or services directly, you can still promote what you are selling offline. A Web site is often more effective as a marketing tool than a selling tool. The site can provide in-depth information, multimedia demos, and other promotion materials that just aren’t possible in print advertising.
- Provide customer services. You can use your Web site to communicate with customers, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For example, you can provide company information, product news and updates, and customer support. Value-added services, such as order tracking and financing applications, help maintain good customer relations. A Web site is also a convenient way for customers to get in touch with you.
- Contact new customers. Millions of people use the Web to research interests and needs. A Web site is an efficient tool for reaching out to new customers and telling them about your business or product.
- Product and market analysis. Every visitor to your Web site can give valuable feedback on products and services. You can survey the potential market for a new product or find out how customers are using an existing product. If your product can easily be delivered online, such as software, you can even test it on potential customers.
- Open the international marketplace. The global Internet is an effective way to expand your business to an international market. You can easily get in touch with customers and partners overseas, and your Web site is open to them even when your offices are not. 
- Communicate with partners. The Web is an efficient and fast communication medium. Use it to connect with business partners, vendors, employees, and others with whom you do business.
- Communicate with the **press（新闻）**. Many **media outlets（媒体渠道）** now accept electronic press kits. Use your Web site to disseminate press releases and to update materials as needed, without the costs of printing and mailing.
- Recruit employees. Many people are turning to the Web to search for jobs. For relatively little money, you can list available jobs and collect resumes from a broad talent base. Which of these goals do you want your Web site to accomplish? Don’t try to do them all, at least not at first. An effective online business concentrates on one or two goals. Later, your Web site can grow to do even more. 



**Types of online businesses**

​	Most businesses don’t use Web sites to make money or generate sales, at least not directly. Creating a Web site to provide customer services or publish company information contributes to sales via other channels. For example, many potential customers use the Web to research a product before buying it elsewhere. However, a lot of businesses do want to make money off their Web sites.Several models have been developed for creating profitable online businesses: 

- Web **storefronts（店面）**. Some products are particularly well adapted to selling online, such as **mail-order（邮购）** items. Web storefronts encompass the entire purchasing process, from providing product information, to taking orders and payments, to processing orders and tracking inventory.
- Content providers. Online publishing is a fast-growing medium. You can easily translate print publications, such as newspapers or magazines, into Web publications. Or you can create an information resource just for online access—a portal such as Yahoo!1 (www.yahoo.com) is a good example of this kind of service. Online content providers make money in two ways: advertisements and subscriptions. The advertising method works well for general information resources, while more specialized resources are better suited to selling subscriptions directly to the targeted audience. 
- Free-based services. If you can enhance your service with a Web site, you can reach more customers and do more business electronically. For example, stockbrokers, real estate listings, job listings, and classified ads are all free-based services that translate well into online services.
- Consulting services. Many kinds of consulting services benefit from being online, such as Web site design and promotion services. You can reach a wider client base, exchange files, and communicate electronically, cutting mail and phone costs.

**Computer Security** 

THREATS TO COMPUTER SECURITY

​	Threats to computer security are computer crimes (including viruses and electronic **break-ins（入侵）**) and natural and other **hazards(危害)**. 

Computer Criminals

​	A computer crime is an illegal action in which the **perpetrator（犯罪者）** uses special knowledge of computer technology. Computer criminals are of four types: 

- **Employees:** The largest category of computer criminals consists of those with the easiest access to computers—namely, employees. Sometimes the employee is simply trying to steal something from the employer—equipment, software, electronic funds, **proprietary(所有的，私人的)** information, or computer time. Sometimes the employee may be acting **out of（由于）** **resentment（怨恨）** and is trying to **“get back”（报复）** at the company.
- **Outside Users：** Not only employees but also some suppliers or clients may have access to a company’s computer system. Examples are bank customers who use an automatic teller machine. Like employees, these authorized users may obtain confidential passwords or find other ways of committing computer crimes.
- **“Hackers” and “Crackers”:** Some people think of these two groups as being the same, but they are not. Hackers are people who gain unauthorized access to a computer system for the fun and challenge of it. Crackers do the same thing but for **malicious（恶毒的）** purposes. They may intend to steal technical information or to introduce what they call a “bomb”—a destructive computer program—into the system.
- **Organized Crime：** Organized crime has discovered that computers can be used just like legitimate business people use them, but for illegal purposes. For example, computers are useful for keeping track of **stolen goods** or illegal gambling debts. In addition, **counterfeiters（伪造者）** and **forgers** use microcomputers and printers to produce sophisticated-looking documents such as checks and driver’s licenses. 



**Computer Crime** 

​	Computer crime can take various forms, including:

- Damage **Disgruntled（不满）** employees sometimes attempt to destroy computers, programs, or files. In recent years, computer viruses have gained wide **notoriety（臭名昭著）**. Viruses are programs that “migrate” through networks and operating systems and attach themselves to different programs and databases. A **variant（变种）** on the virus is the worm. This destructive program fills a computer system with self-replicating information, **clogging（阻塞）** the system so that its operations are slowed or stopped. The most infamous is known as the Internet Worm. In 1988, it traveled across North America, stopping thousands of computers along its way. Viruses typically find their way into microcomputers through copied floppy disks or programs downloaded from electronic bulletin boards. Because viruses can be so serious—certain “disk-killer” viruses can destroy all the information on one’s system—computer users are advised to exercise care in accepting new programs and data from other sources. Detection programs called virus checkers are available to alert users when certain kinds of viruses enter the system. Unfortunately, new viruses are being developed all the time, and not all viruses can be detected. There are recommended procedures to reduce the risk of catching a computer virus and to minimize its potential damage. 
- **Theft：** Theft can take many forms—of hardware, of software, of data, of computer time. Thieves steal equipment, of course, but there are also “white-collar crimes.” Thieves steal data in the form of **confidential（机密）** information such as preferred client lists. They also use (steal) their company’s computer time to run another business. Unauthorized copying—a form of theft—of programs for personal gain is called software **piracy（盗版）**. Pirated software accounts for 40 percent of software used in the United States. The **incidence（发生率）** of pirated software is even higher overseas in such countries as Italy (82 percent) and Thailand (92 percent).
- **Manipulation：** Finding entry into someone’s computer network and leaving a **prankster’s（顽皮的人）** message may seem like fun, which is why hackers do it. It is still against the law. Moreover, even if the manipulation seems harmless, it may cause a great deal of anxiety and wasted time among network users. 
- **Other Hazards：** There are plenty of other hazards to computer systems and data besides criminals. They include the following: 
  - **Natural Hazards：** Natural forces include fires, floods, wind, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes. Even home computer users should store backup disks of programs and data in safe locations in case of fire or storm damage.
  - **Civil Strife（冲突） and Terrorism：** Wars, **riots（暴动）**, and other forms of political **unrest（不安）** are real risks in some parts of the world. Even people in developed countries, however, must be mindful that acts of **sabotage（蓄意破坏）** are possible.
  - **Technological Failures** Hardware and software don’t always do what they are supposed to do. For instance, too little electricity, caused by a **brownout（电压不足）** or **blackout（断电）**, may cause the loss of data in primary storage. Too much electricity, as when lightning or other electrical disturbance affects a power line, may cause a voltage surge, or **spike（猛增）**. This excess of electricity may destroy chips or other electronic components of a computer. Most microcomputer users buy a surge protector, a device that separates the computer from the power source of the wall outlet. When a voltage surge occurs, it activates a circuit breaker in the surge protector, protecting the computer system. Another technological catastrophe is when a hard-disk drive suddenly “crashes,” or fails, perhaps because it has been bumped **inadvertently（无意间）**. If the user has forgotten to make backup copies of data on the hard disk, data may be lost. 
  - **Human Errors：** Human mistakes are inevitable. Data-entry errors are probably the most **commonplace（平凡的）**. Programmer errors also occur frequently. Some mistakes may result from faulty design, as when a software manufacturer makes a deletion command closely resembling another command. Some errors may be the result of **sloppy（马虎的）** procedures. One such example occurs when office workers keep important correspondence under filenames that no one else in the office knows. 



**MEASURES TO PROTECT COMPUTER SECURITY** 

​	Security is concerned with protecting information, hardware, and software. Security measures consist of encryption, restricting access, **anticipating disasters（预测灾难）**, and making backup copies.

**Encrypting Messages** 

​	Whenever information is sent over a network, the possibility of unauthorized access exists. The longer the distance the message has to travel, the higher the security risk is. For example, an e-mail message on a LAN meets a limited number of users operating in controlled environments such as offices. An e-mail message traveling across the country on the National Information Highway affords greater opportunities for the message to be **intercepted（拦截）**. Businesses have been encrypting, or coding, messages for years. They have become so good at it that some law enforcement agencies are unable to “**wiretap（窃听）**” messages from suspected criminals. Some federal agencies have suggested that a standard encryption procedure be used so that law enforcement agencies can monitor suspected criminal communications. The government is encouraging businesses that use the National Information Highway to use a special encryption program. **This program is available on a processor chip called the clipper chip（加密芯片） and is also known as the key escrow（托管） chip.** Individuals are also using encryption programs to safeguard their private communications. One of the most widely used personal encryption programs is Pretty Good Privacy. 

**Restricting Access** 

​	Security experts are constantly devising ways to protect computer systems from access by unauthorized persons. Sometimes security is a matter of putting guards on company computer rooms and checking the identification of everyone admitted. Oftentimes it is a matter of being careful about assigning passwords to people and of changing them when people leave a company. Passwords are secret words or numbers that must be keyed into a computer system to gain access. In some “dial-back” computer systems, the user telephones the computer, punches in the correct password, and hangs up. The computer then calls back at a certain **preauthorized（预先授权的）** number. Most major corporations today use special hardware and software called firewalls to control access to their internal computer networks. These firewalls act as a **security buffer（安全缓冲区）** between the corporation’s private network and all external networks, including the Internet. All electronic communications coming into and leaving the corporation must be evaluated by the firewall. Security is maintained by denying access to unauthorized communications. 

**Anticipating Disasters** 

​	Companies (and even individuals) that do not make preparations for disasters are not acting wisely. Physical security is concerned with protecting hardware from possible human and natural disasters. Data security is concerned with protecting software and data from unauthorized **tampering（干预）** or damage. Most large organizations have a disaster recovery plan describing ways to continue operating until normal computer operations can be restored. Hardware can be kept behind locked doors, but often employees find this restriction a **hindrance（妨碍）**, so security is lax. Fire and water (including the water from ceiling sprinkler systems) can do great damage to equipment. Many companies therefore will form a cooperative arrangement to share equipment with other companies in the event of catastrophe. Special emergency facilities called hot sites may be created if they are fully equipped computer centers. They are called cold sites if they are empty shells in which hardware must be installed. 

**Backing up Data** 

​	Equipment can always be replaced. A company’s data, however, may be irreplaceable. Most companies have ways of trying to keep software and data from being tampered with in the first place. They include careful screening of job applicants, guarding of passwords, and auditing of data and programs from time to time. The safest procedure, however, is to make frequent backups of data and to store them in remote locations. 

**Security for Microcomputers** 

​	If you own a microcomputer system, there are several procedures to follow to keep it safe: 

- Avoid Extreme Conditions Don’t expose the computer to extreme conditions. Direct sun, rain from an open window, extreme temperatures, cigarette smoke, and spilled drinks or food are harmful to microcomputers. Clean your equipment regularly. Use a surge protector to protect against voltage surges. 
- Guard the Computer Put a cable lock on the computer. If you subscribe or belong to an online information service, do not leave passwords nearby in a place accessible by others. **Etch（雕刻）** your driver’s license number or social security number into your equipment. That way it can be identified in the event it is recovered after theft.
- Guard Programs and Data Store disks properly, preferably in a locked container. Make backup copies of all your important files and programs. Store copies of your files in a different—and safe—location from the site of your computer.
