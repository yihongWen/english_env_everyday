**Geographic Information System** 

​	What Is a GIS? A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer-based tool for mapping and analyzing things that exist and events that happen on earth. GIS technology integrates common database operations such as query and statistical analysis with the unique visualization and geographic analysis benefits offered by maps. These abilities distinguish a GIS from other information systems and make it valuable to a wide range of public and private enterprises for explaining events, predicting outcomes, and planning strategies. 

​	Mapmaking and geographic analysis are not new, but a GIS performs these tasks better and faster than do the old manual methods. And, before GIS technology, only a few people had the skills necessary to use geographic information to help with decision making and problem solving. Today, GIS is a multibillion-dollar industry employing hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. GIS is taught in schools, colleges, and universities throughout the world. Professionals in every field are increasingly aware of the advantages of thinking and working geographically. 



**What Are the Components of a GIS?** 

​	A working GIS integrates five key components: hardware, software, data, people, and methods. 

**Hardware** 

​	Hardware is the computer on which a GIS operates. Today, GIS software runs on a wide range of hardware types, from centralized computer servers to desktop computers used in **stand-alone（独立的）** or networked configurations.

**Software**

​	GIS software provides the functions and tools needed to store, analyze, and display geographic information. Key software components are:

- Tools for the input and manipulation of geographic information
- A database management system (DBMS) 
- Tools that support geographic query, analysis, and visualization
- A graphical user interface (GUI) for easy access to tools 

**Data** 

​	Possibly the most important component of a GIS is the data. Geographic data and related **tabular（表格）** data can be collected in-house or purchased from a commercial data provider. A GIS will integrate spatial data with other data resources and can even use a DBMS, used by most organizations to organize and maintain their data, to manage spatial data.

**People** 

​	GIS technology is of limited value without the people who manage the system and develop plans for applying it to real-world problems. GIS users range from technical specialists who design and maintain the system to those who use it to help them perform their everyday work.

**Methods** 

​	A successful GIS operates according to a well-designed plan and business rules, which are the models and operating practices unique to each organization. 



**How Does a GIS Work?** 

​	A GIS stores information about the world as a collection of thematic layers that can be linked together by geography. This simple but extremely powerful and **versatile（通用） concept** has proven **invaluable（无价的）** for solving many real-world problems from tracking delivery vehicles, to recording details of planning applications, to modeling global atmospheric circulation.

**Geographic References** 

​	Geographic information contains either an explicit geographic reference, such as a **latitude（纬度）** and **longitude（经度）** or national **grid（网格）** coordinate, or an implicit reference such as an address, postal code, or road name. An automated process called geocoding is used to create explicit geographic references (multiple locations) from implicit references (descriptions such as addresses). These geographic references allow you to locate features and events on the earth’s surface for analysis.

**Vector and Raster（光栅） Models** 

Geographic information systems work with two fundamentally different types of geographic models—the “vector” model and the “raster” model. In the vector model, information about points, lines, and **polygons（多边形）** is encoded and stored as a collection of x,y coordinates. The location of a point feature, such as a bore hole, can be described by a single x,y coordinate. Linear features, such as roads and rivers, can be stored as a collection of point coordinates. Polygonal features, such as sales **territories（领土）** and river **catchments（流域）**, can be stored as a closed loop of coordinates. The vector model is extremely useful for describing **discrete（离散）** features, but less useful for describing continuously varying features such as soil type. The raster model has evolved to model such continuous features. A raster image comprises a collection of grid cells rather like a scanned map or picture. Both the vector and raster models for storing geographic data have unique advantages and disadvantages. Modern GISs are able to handle both models.

 

**What Can a GIS Do for You?** 

**Performing Geographic Queries and Analysis** 

​	The ability of GISs to search databases and perform geographic queries has saved many companies literally millions of dollars. GISs have helped reduce costs by:

- **Streamlining(精简)** customer service 
- Reducing land acquisition costs through better analysis
- Reducing fleet maintenance costs through better **logistics（后勤、物流）**
- Analyzing data quickly 

​	An example of the last point is: a **realtor（房地产经纪人）** could use a GIS to find all houses within a certain area that have tiled roofs and five bedrooms, and then list their characteristics. The query could be further **refined（精炼）** by adding **criteria（标准、条件）**—the house must cost less than $100 per square foot. You could also list houses within a certain distance of a school. 

**Improving Organizational Integration** 

​	Many organizations that have implemented a GIS have found that one of its main benefits is improved management of their own organization and resources. Because GISs have the ability to link data sets together by geography, they facilitate **interdepartmental（不同学科之间）** information sharing and communication. By creating a shared database, one department can benefit from the work of another—data can be collected once and used many times. 

**Making Better Decisions** 

​	The old **adage（谚语）** “**better information leads to better decisions**” is as true for a GIS as it is for other information systems. A GIS, however, is not an automated decision making system but a tool to query, analyze, and map data in support of the decision making process. GIS technology has been used to assist in tasks such as presenting information at planning inquiries, helping resolve territorial **disputes（争端）**, and siting **pylons（塔架）** in such a way as to minimize visual **intrusion（侵入）**. A GIS can be used to help reach a decision about the location of a new housing development that has minimal environmental impact, is located in a low-risk area, and is close to a population center. The information can be presented **succinctly（简洁）** and clearly in the form of a map and accompanying report, allowing decision makers to focus on the real issues rather than try to understand the data. Because GIS products can be produced quickly, multiple scenarios can be evaluated efficiently and effectively. 

**Making Maps** 

​	Maps have a special place in GIS (see Figure 12B-1). The process of making maps with GIS is much more flexible than are traditional manual or automated cartography approaches. It begins with database creation. Existing paper maps can be digitized and computer-**compatible（兼容）** information can be translated into the GIS. The GIS-based **cartographic（制图的）** database can be both continuous and scale free. Map products can then be created centered on any location, at any scale, and showing selected information symbolized effectively to highlight specific characteristics. The characteristics of **atlases（地图册）** and map series can be encoded in computer programs and compared with the database at final production time. Digital products for use in other GISs can also be derived by simply copying data from the database. In a large organization, **topographic（地质的）** databases can be used as reference frameworks by other departments. 



**Summary** 

​	In today’s global community, the more information you have at your fingertips, the easier it is to make an informed decision. In today’s high-tech world, information comes in many different ways, from company reports and statistics from down the hall to digital photos and multimedia from across the world. Information can be overwhelming and the need for timely decisions calls not only for innovative ways to access accurate, up-to-the-minute information, but also tools to help present the information in useful ways. A geographic information system or GIS allows you to bring all types of data together based on the geographic and locational component of the data. But unlike a static paper map, GIS can display many layers of information that is useful to you. GIS will give you the power to create maps, integrate information, visualize scenarios, solve complicated problems, present powerful ideas, and develop effective solutions like never before. Relationships between the data will become more apparent and your data will become more valuable. GIS is a tool used by individuals, schools, governments, and businesses seeking innovative ways to solve their problems.

**Agent Technology**

**Introduction What is an agent?** 

​	In essence, an agent is a software system which can act on behalf of a human or another system. Agent is a convenient **metaphor（比喻）** for describing software systems which we would all like to have—the “intelligent software servant” that is easy to instruct. In research, a more **rigorous（严密的）** definition which is often used is: an agent is a software system, situated in some environment, which is capable of behaviour that is proactive, autonomous, communicative, persistent, and timely. Some agents might have additional attributes such as **mobility（活动性）**, **benevolence（慈善）**, and learning ability. Stronger notions of agency employ concepts such as knowledge, belief, goals and intentions, and provide a logic for **reasoning（推理）** with these concepts. These properties are useful and reflect human intelligence but they are hard to fully realize in a software system. Not all agents have (or need) all these properties, and some agents have these properties in varying degrees. We rely on **intuition（直觉）** to perceive and judge the degree of these properties in a software system, since the properties are generally difficult to quantify or measure. Nevertheless, numerous theories for understanding and modelling properties of agent systems and tools for building agents are being developed in over fifty research laboratories world-wide. The Agent Society (www.agent.org) and AgentLink (www.agentlink.org) are two international organizations formed for the purposes of coordinating agent research and development. Agent research crosses **disciplines（科学、训练）** and has been influenced by areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed computing, software engineering, sociology, economics, object-oriented systems, artificial life, and game theory. In fact, a strength of agent technology is that it combines such areas to build systems more sophisticated than that possible using one technology alone. This strength and the appeal of the agent abstraction accounts in part for the diversity of software solutions possible with the concept of agents. 

**Applications** 

​	We look at a sampling of agent application areas.

**The Internet and the World Wide Web** 

​	The Web provides an **impetus（动力）** for agent research. Information agents naturally fit the role of software assistants which help people find, reason with, synthesize, and manage desired knowledge from the gargantuan Web. While Web documents have some structure, much of the information is still in free text, **hindering（阻碍）** full understanding of text by agents. However, useful agents for gathering, filtering, sharing, and monitoring Web resources and guiding Web surfers have been built using limited natural language processing and complex keyword-based text searching. Such agent products have been deployed and are being marketed. 

​	XML , which generalizes HTML to admit domain-specific tags, provides a standard way of imposing more structure on information. However, the use of XML is still limited compared to HTML. 

​	Email filtering and responding is another application where agents prioritize, delete, forward or archive messages for users. Useful tools have been built and marketed without full natural language understanding.

**Electronic Commerce** 

​	Electronic commerce is an area of growing importance **spurred（鞭策）** by the popularity of the Internet and the Web. While the Web enables a company to be online twenty-four hours a day and be **contactable（可接触的）** by the masses, it also provides an electronic storefront with which agents can interact. Intensive agent research is **underway（在进行中）** to automate product advertising and **brokering（代理）**, merchant brokering, negotiation, purchase and delivery, and customer services. Full and effective automation of electronic commerce is **nontrivial（重要的）** and requires not only technological designs but also standards for **unambiguously（不含糊的）** defining commerce-related information such as goods and services, customer and business profiles, and electronic forms.

**Manufacturing**

​	Manufacturing control and factory automation is an area of active research. Agent systems are being developed for designing products, controlling manufacturing robots, and managing factory production processes. 

**And More…** 

​	Other areas of agent research and development include business process management (agent-based systems for streamlining business processes have been developed), telecommunications (e.g. automating network management and efficient service provisioning), medical informatics (e.g. automating decision making in patient monitoring and multi-agent based distributed health care system), entertainment, air traffic control, pilot training, and distributed data mining.



**Mobile Computing—Software and Hardware** 

​	The increasingly distributed and mobile workforce and enterprise is **fueling（给...提供燃料）** research into mobile agent systems. The **attraction（吸引力）** is the ability to send agents to remote hosts, disconnect from these hosts, and reconnect to retrieve answers. For agents to roam the Internet, the capability of “write once, run anywhere” is **imperative（极其重要的）**. Sun’s Java language which has captured the world’s attention via Web applets has provision for platform independent execution, and so, has been used for more than a dozen mobile agent toolkits. With Java being introduced in “soft” embedded devices such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants and **handheld（手持）** terminals, agents might (if need to) roam mobile environments. However, mobile agent research has so far largely been confined toresearch proposals and prototypes. There is hardly any commercial **off-the-shelf（现成的）** mobile agent-based application. Further research in building **robust（强壮的）** mobile agent applications is still required. Issues such as security and robustness are being **tackled（处理）**—mobile agents might become **commonplace（平凡的）** in the next decade. 



**Standardization** 

​	For agents to cooperate, flexible and standard means of agent communication is required. Development and standardization of agent communication languages is being carried out. FIPA1 (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) (www.fipa.org), a standards organization in the agent area, has more than forty participants including British Telecom2 , Hitachi3 , NEC, Siemens4 , IBM, and Sun Microsystems. FIPA aims to make available specifications that facilitate inter-operability between agent systems. Specifications for agent management (e.g. directory services, and life cycle) and agent communication have been proposed. The Object Management Group® (OMGTM) (www.omg.org) is also working on standards to allow mobile agent systems to inter-operate. 

**Conclusion**

​	 Agent technology is a thriving area of research, and it is also an emerging industry. As toolkits and methodologies for developing agent systems emerge, applications where agents will be a key abstraction will increase.

**Electronic Commerce** 

**DEFINITION** 

​	Electronic commerce may be defined as the entire set of processes that support commercial activities on a network and involve information analysis. These activities **spawn(大量生产)** product information and display events, services, providers, consumers, advertisers, support for transactions, brokering systems for a variety of services and actions (e.g., finding certain products, finding cheaply priced products, etc.), security of transactions, user authentication, etc. It involves “the enablement of a business vision supported by advanced information technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness within the trading process”. Although the term itself has gained attention only in recent years, electronic commerce has been around in various forms for over 20 years. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and **Electronic Funds Transfer（电子资金传送）** (EFT2 ) technologies were first introduced in the late 1970s. The growth and acceptance of credit cards, **Automated Teller（出纳） Machines（自动取款机）** , and telephone banking in the 1980s are also forms of EC . While many of these electronic trading technologies have had radical effects within their own markets and created their fair share of publicity, none have attracted the level of **hype（炒作）** or have been **hailed（赞扬、欢呼）** as **purveyors** of economic transformation to the extent that electronic commerce has in recent years. 



**REQUIREMENTS AND SERVICES** 

​	In order to effectively use electronic commerce, users of such systems require various types of **wide-ranging（广泛）** functionalities that include the ability to search for and access relevant information efficiently, make monetary transactions for purchasing and selling products and services, and secure business transactions against intentional and unintentional **corruption（腐败、损害）** and theft of data. 

**Acquiring and Storing Information**

​	To build a global electronic marketplace, first we need to deal with the problem of digitizing currently available information such as catalogs, books, films, maps, and audio at a variety of quality levels. Data may also already exist in digital form but in a **legacy（遗产、遗留）** format that must be transformed to be useful. In addition to the technical aspect of this problem, there is also the economic aspect—the costs of digitizing or converting the information. Second, as new information is made available by information providers (individuals, small businesses, large corporations) we need to have mechanisms to capture and store this information. An EC storage system must be capable of storing a large amount of data in a variety of formats and must provide efficient and effective access to this data. 

**Search and Discovery Services** 

​	Online information search capabilities are important to provide users access to important data such as information about products, services, customers, suppliers, and government agencies. Information search and discovery services include electronic catalogs (e-catalogs) and directories, information filters, search engines, and software agents. Electronic catalogs organize information based on content and allow users to browse through and select the relevant documents. Such methods, while simple to implement, assume certain organization schemes that may not match the requirement of every user. Furthermore, for systems that require frequent updates, such methods may not be efficient because of the frequency of reorganization required. Information filters are available for users to retrieve the relevant documents to their queries. These filters could be located at the workstation of the end users or at remote sites. Retrieving information from remote sites increases network traffic, and hence it is more efficient to gather metadata rather than to download the data itself. Multimedia information poses additional problems in determining information content and hence in filtering such data. 

​	Software agents such as robots, wanderers, and spiders can traverse and locate relevant information. Such programs are based on limited-depth, depth-first algorithms that traverse using hypertext links through HTML documents in the Web in order to locate and retrieve relevant documents. Several open issues persist with the existing discovery and search services. These include the ability to handle new types of data such as multimedia data including video, sound, and 3D images; developing more efficient content-based indexing methods; and using parallel processing to conduct multiple searches through the document space. 

**Electronic Payments** 

​	EC systems require methods to pay for the delivery of data, products, and services. Electronic payments include digital currencies (smart cards and electronic money), credit card payments, and electronic checks. Smart cards have been developed and are in use for various types of business services—to provide access to financial accounts, to maintain purchase records, and to store personalized information such as shopping **preferences（偏好）** and other data. There are two types of smart cards: relationship-based smart cards that allow financial transactions but require accounting settlements at the end of each billing cycle, and electronic purses and **debit cards（借记卡）** that store sums of money and can be used for a variety of services. After each purchase, the value is **deducted（扣除）** from the electronic purse, and hence no accounting settlement is necessary. 

​	Electronic money (also referred to as digital cash or electronic token) is an electronic payment method that **emulates（仿真）** the real-life exchange of goods and services for their equivalent currencies. Thus, electronic tokens could be stored in users’ computers and transmitted through fixed or intermittent network connections. E-money should be bank-certified for their monetary value in order to avoid the risk of insufficient funds. In addition, these should be exchangeable with other forms of payments (such as paper cash and certified checks), must be **tamper（破坏、篡改）** resistant in order to avoid **fraudulent（欺骗）** payments, and should be accessible from remote locations. As an alternative to storing electronic tokens in the users’ machines, third-party payment services can process payment transactions. Credit card purchases involve the transmission of encrypted data through computer networks. This includes entering credit card information (card number and expiration date) into the system, having it encrypted by the system, and sending the information over the network. The problem with this type of system is their **nonrefutability（不可辩驳）,** which requires the physical presence of the credit card owner for authentication of the signature. Other problems associated with such payment methods are privacy, speed of transactions, and safety. Electronic checks (e-checks) are another mechanism for payments over computer networks. These systems are intended to emulate conventional paper-check processing systems. In this method, a third-party account server acts as a billing service for users. E-checks require digital signatures and authentication services to digitally process information between the payer, payee, and bank. E-checks are suitable for clearing micropayments and are much faster and more efficient than conventional check payment systems. Society has grown accustomed to a wide variety of cost models and financial instruments. EC, however, presents new challenges that are not adequately addressed by these models and instruments. For example, online services presently follow fixed-cost models that are insensitive to changes in data contents and wholesale costs. 

**Security Services** 

​	Systems for electronic commerce have to be secured against a number of threats such as fraudulent activities by internal or external sources, theft of valuable information, and **sabotage（故意毁坏）**. Hence such systems need to be guarded by some specially designed security system to provide security services such as authentication of data and of the entities accessing the system, unauthorized access control, confidentiality, data integrity, and non-**repudiation（否认、拒绝）**. Security systems typically consist of a cryptographic system that performs the encryption of plain text data into **ciphertext（密文）** and decryption of ciphertext back into plain text data. Cryptographic systems can be divided into two categories: a symmetric key cryptosystem where the key information is shared and kept secret between the sender and receiver, and a public key cryptosystem where the sender and the receiver do not share the same key (one can be made public while the other is kept secret). Both symmetric key and public key cryptosystems provide security services such as confidentiality, authentication of data source, and integrity. These are achieved through a variety of techniques, namely, message authentication codes and hash functions in symmetric key cryptosystems and the use of public and private keys in public key cryptosystems. Cryptographic systems of today face various challenges, for example, acceptance of such systems by user groups, distribution and management of keys, and the ease of use of effective encryption and decryption mechanisms. 

**Connectivity** 

​	In an EC environment today, there is a multiplicity of clients. Users may use TV sets, radios, PCs, PDAs1 , laptops, and cellular phones for accessing information. The goal of the National Information Infrastructure (NII 2 ) project is to allow universal access to distributed stores of information (digital libraries) and to provide this access at a reasonable cost to every citizen. Widespread use of EC is predicated on, among others, the universal availability of access for a large number of users. EC systems will have to contend with many different information appliances. In such a heterogeneous world of objects, user interfaces, networks, clients, and servers, the issue of interoperability assumes great importance. 

**Legal and Policy Requirements** 

​	The legal issues involved in electronic commerce relate to the trouble the Internet itself has in dealing with law in **cyberspace（网络空间）**. Legal disputes that have been debated for centuries have begun to surface in cyberspace with renewed **vigor（活力）**. Fundamental civil liberties issues demand new attention in a new environment, and the **ramifications（分支）** of past decisions are not the same in a globally networked environment. While governments and individuals struggle to address freedom of speech, obscenity, and privacy issues on the Internet, the legal issues for electronic commerce are numerous as well. **Intellectual property（知识产权）,** taxation, law enforcement, ubiquitous cryptography, and **contractual（合同）** issues are all unsettled in the growing EC industry. Furthermore, the debate over government involvement in the regulation of electronic business, itself, is still at an immature stage. The issues that require resolution are becoming clear for EC.
