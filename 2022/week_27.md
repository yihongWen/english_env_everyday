​	“Men,” said the little prince, “**set out(出发)** on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round. . . ” And he added: “It is not worth the trouble. . . ” The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming. . . “It is strange,” I said to the little prince. “Everything is ready for use: the **pulley(滑轮)**, the bucket, the rope. . . ” He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old **weathervane（风向标）** which the wind has long since forgotten.

​	“Do you hear?” said the little prince. “We have wakened the well, and it is singing. . . ” I did not want him to tire himself with the rope. “Leave it to me,” I said. “It is too heavy for you.” I **hoisted（提起）** the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there– happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight **shimmer（闪烁）** in the still trembling water. “I am thirsty for this water,” said the little prince. “Give me some of it to drink. . . ” And I understood what he had been looking for.

​	I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary **nourishment（营养）**. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the **tenderness（亲切）** of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received. “The men where you live,” said the little prince, “raise five thousand roses in the same garden– and they do not find in it what they are looking for.” “They do not find it,” I replied. “And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.” “Yes, that is true,” I said. And the little prince added: “But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart. . . ” I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief? “You must keep your promise,” said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more. “What promise?” “You know– a muzzle for my sheep. . . I am responsible for this flower. . . ”

​	I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said: “Your baobabs– they look a little like cabbages.” “Oh!” I had been so proud of my baobabs! “Your fox– his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long.” And he laughed again. “You are not fair, little prince,” I said. “I don’t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.” “Oh, that will be all right,” he said, “children understand.” So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn. “You have plans that I do not know about,” I said. But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead: “You know– my **descent（下降、降落）** to the earth. . . Tomorrow will be its anniversary.” Then, after a silence, he went on: “I came down very near here.” And he flushed. And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me: “Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you– a week ago– you were **strolling（闲逛）** along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?” The little prince flushed again.

​	And I added, with some hesitancy: “Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?” The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions– but when one flushes does that not mean “Yes”? “Ah,” I said to him, “I am a little frightened–” But he interrupted me. “Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening. . . ” But I was not **reassured（使安心）**. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed. . .





## 06-28:

​	Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet **dangling(悬挂、摇摆)**. And I heard him say: “Then you don’t remember. This is not the exact spot.” Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it: “Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place.” I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again: “–Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight.” I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing. After a silence the little prince spoke again: “You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?” I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand. “Now go away,” said the little prince. “I want to get down from the wall.”

​	I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall– and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my **revolver（左轮手枪）** I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying **spray（浪花）** of a **fountain（喷泉）**, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light **metallic（金属）** sound, among the stones.

​	I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow. “What does this mean?” I demanded. “Why are you talking with snakes?” I had loosened the golden **muffler（围巾）** that he always **wore（穿戴）**. I had **moistened（弄湿）** his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone’s rifle. . . “I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,” he said. “Now you can go back home–” “How do you know about that?” I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope. He made no answer to my question, but he added: “I, too, am going back home today. . . ” Then, sadly– “It is much farther. . . it is much more difficult. . . ” I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an **abyss（深渊）** from which I could do nothing to restrain him. . . His look was very serious, like some one lost far away. “I have your sheep. And I have the sheep’s box. And I have the muzzle. . . ” And he gave me a sad smile. I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little. “Dear little man,” I said to him, “you are afraid. . . ” He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly. “I shall be much more afraid this evening. . . ” Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something **irreparable（不可抵抗的）**. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert. “Little man,” I said, “I want to hear you laugh again.”

​	But he said to me: “Tonight, it will be a year. . . my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago. . . ” “Little man,” I said, “tell me that it is only a bad dream– this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star. . . ” But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead: “The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen. . . ” “Yes, I know. . . ” “It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers. . . ” “Yes, I know. . . ”

​	“It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember– how good it was.” “Yes, I know. . . ” “And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens. . . they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present. . . ” He laughed again. “Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!” “That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water. . . ” “What are you trying to say?” **“All men have the stars,” he answered, “but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You– you alone– will have the stars as no one else has them–” “**What are you trying to say?” “In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night. . . you– only you– will have stars that can laugh!” And he laughed again. **“And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me**. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure. . . and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, ‘Yes, the stars always make me laugh!’ And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you. . . ”

​	And he laughed again. “It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little **bells（铃铛）** that knew how to laugh. . . ” And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious: “Tonight– you know. . . do not come,” said the little prince. “I shall not leave you,” I said. “I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth the trouble. . . ” “I shall not leave you.” But he was worried. “I tell you– it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes– they are **malicious（恶意的）** creatures. This one might bite you just for fun. . . ” “I shall not leave you.” But a thought came to reassure him: “It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.”

​	That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and **resolute（坚定的）** step. He said to me merely: “Ah! You are there. . . ” And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying. “It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true. . . ” I said nothing. “You understand. . . it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.” I said nothing. “But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells. . . ” I said nothing. He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort: “You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink. . . ” I said nothing. “That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water. . . ” And he too said nothing more, becuase he was crying. . . “Here it is. Let me go on by myself.” And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again: “You know– my flower. . . I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She is so na¨ıve! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world. . . ” I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer. “There now– that is all. . . ” He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move. There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained **motionless（静止）** for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.

​	And now six years have already gone by. . . I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: “I am tired.” Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say– not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body. . . and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells. . . But there is one extraordinary thing. . . when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the **leather strap（皮带）** to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower. . . At one time I say to myself: “Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully. . . ” Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars. But at another time I say to myself: “At some moment or other one is **absent-minded（心不在焉）,** and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night. . . ” And then the little bells are changed to tears. . . Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has– yes or no?– eaten a rose. . . Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes. . . And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance! This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory. It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared.

​	Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has come back.

​	A computer is an electronic device that can receive a set of instructions, or program, and then carry out this program by performing calculations on numerical data or by manipulating other forms of information. The modern world of high technology could not have come about except for the development of the computer. Different types and sizes of computers find uses throughout society in the storage and handling of data, from secret governmental files to banking transactions to private household accounts. Computers have opened up a new era in manufacturing through the techniques of automation, and they have enhanced modern communication systems. They are essential tools in almost every field of research and applied technology, from constructing models of the universe to producing tomorrow’s weather reports, and their use has in itself opened up new areas of **conjecture(猜测)**. Database services and computer networks make available a great variety of information sources. The same advanced techniques also make possible **invasions(入侵)** of personal and business privacy. Computer crime has become one of the many risks that are part of the price of modern technology. 

​	The first adding machine, a precursor of the digital computer, was devised in 1642 by the French scientist, mathematician, and philosopher Blaise Pascal. This device employed a series of ten-toothed wheels, each tooth representing a digit from 0 to 9. The wheels were connected so that numbers could be added to each other by advancing the wheels by a correct number of teeth. In the 1670s the German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  improved on this machine by devising one that could also multiply. The French inventor Joseph-Marie Jacquard , in designing an automatic **loom(织机)**, used thin, **perforated（穿卡）** wooden boards to control the weaving of complicated designs. During the 1880s the American statistician Herman Hollerith **conceived（构想）** the idea of using perforated cards, similar to Jacquard’s boards, for processing data. Employing a system that passed punched cards over electrical contacts, he was able to compile statistical information for the 1890 United States census.

A. The Analytical Engine

​	Also in the 19th century, the British mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage worked out the principles of the modern digital computer. He conceived a number of machines, such as the **Difference Engine（差分机）**, that were designed to handle complicated mathematical problems. Many historians consider Babbage and his **associate（助手）**, the mathematician Augusta Ada Byron , the true pioneers of the modern digital computer. One of Babbage’s designs, the Analytical Engine, had many features of a modern computer. It had an input stream in the form of a deck of punched cards, a “store” for saving data, a “**mill（磨坊、工厂）**” for arithmetic operations, and a printer that made a permanent record.Babbage failed to put this idea into practice, though it may well have been technically possible at that date. 

B. Early Computers 

​	Analogue computers began to be built in the late 19th century. Early models calculated by means of rotating **shafts（轴）** and **gears（齿轮、变速箱）**. Numerical approximations of equations too difficult to solve in any other way were evaluated with such machines. Lord Kelvin built a mechanical tide predictor that was a specialized analogue computer. During World Wars I and II, mechanical and, later, electrical analogue computing systems were used as **torpedo（鱼雷）** course predictors in submarines and as bombsight controllers in aircraft. Another system was designed to predict spring floods in the Mississippi River basin. 

C. Electronic Computers

​	During World War II, a team of scientists and mathematicians, working at Bletchley Park, north of London, created one of the first all-electronic digital computers: Colossus. By December 1943, Colossus, which **incorporated（包含、组成）** 1,500 vacuum tubes, was operational. It was used by the team headed by Alan Turing , in the largely successful attempt to crack German radio messages **enciphered（被编码的）** in the **Enigma（谜团）** code . Independently of this, in the United States, a **prototype（原型）** electronic machine had been built as early as 1939, by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry at Iowa State College. This prototype and later research were completed quietly and later **overshadowed（被掩盖）** by the development of the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC 4 ) in 1945. ENIAC was granted a patent, which was overturned decades later, in 1973, when the machine was revealed to have incorporated principles first used in the Atanasoff-Berry Computer. 

​	ENIAC (See Figure 1A-1) contained 18,000 vacuum tubes and had a speed of several hundred multiplications per minute, but originally its program was wired into the processor and had to be manually altered. Later machines were built with program storage, based on the ideas of the Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann . The instructions, like the data, were stored within a “memory”, freeing the computer from the speed limitations of the paper-tape reader during execution and permitting problems to be solved without rewiring the computer. The use of the transistor in computers in the late 1950s marked the advent of smaller, faster, and more **versatile（多用途）** logical elements than were possible with vacuum-tube machines. Because transistors use much less power and have a much longer life, this development alone was responsible for the improved machines called second-generation computers. Components became smaller, as did inter-component spacings, and the system became much less expensive to build
